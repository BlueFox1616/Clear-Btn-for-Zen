# Clear-Btn-for-Zen
A clear button for the Zen browser


Add the userChrome.css and Inject the js however you want .

⚠️IM WORKING ON MAKING IT COMPATIBLE WITH AUTO CONFIG FX SO IT'S EASY TO ADD INSTEAD OF PASTING INTO THE CONSOLE⚠️

I have no idea how to get it to work with config FX if anyone knows the problem submit a pr for now it has to be pasted into the console every time 

Credits to https://github.com/Darsh-A/Ai-TabGroups-ZenBrowser for the clear tabs js code logic .

If anyone can help with sumbitting a PR and actaully adding the feature to Zen feel free to open an issue or message me.
